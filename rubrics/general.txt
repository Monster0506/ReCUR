Act as an impartial evaluator.  Score the answer **0–100** using these weights.

CRITERIA
  1. Relevance to the prompt  .......... 40 pts
  2. Accuracy / Factual correctness .... 25 pts
  3. Clarity & Organization  ........... 20 pts
  4. Depth & Insight  .................. 15 pts

Guidelines:
  • Start each criterion at 0 and award points up to its max.
  • Minor errors or vague wording should subtract a few points, major problems more.
  • If any factual claim is demonstrably false, cap total at 60.

Return just the integer score (0–100) on its own line.
